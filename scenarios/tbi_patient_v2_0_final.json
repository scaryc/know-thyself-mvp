Patient has altered mental status (GCS 13) and unequal pupils (right larger, sluggish) - concerning for intracranial bleeding. Vital signs show early hypertension (165/95) and relative bradycardia (HR 68 for injured patient). These could be early signs of rising ICP or just baseline vitals - need to TREND.

What day is it?' He's oriented to person but not to time or exact circumstances. His GCS has improved slightly to 14. The bleeding from his forehead is now controlled with pressure. He's lying supine on a backboard with C-collar, oxygen in place. 'My head really hurts,' he complains. 'Can I have something for the pain?' His pupils, while you watch carefully, remain unequal but he's not getting worse. His vital signs are stable. His wife looks somewhat reassured seeing him more responsive.",

Key is PREVENTION OF SECONDARY BRAIN INJURY - maintain SpO2 greater than 90 percent, SBP greater than 90, avoid hypercapnia, proper positioning (head elevated 30 degrees if no contraindications).

When you check his GCS again, it has dropped to 9 - he only opens eyes to pain, makes incomprehensible sounds, and has abnormal flexion. His right pupil is now noticeably larger than the left - maybe 6mm versus 3mm - and barely reacting to light. His breathing has become irregular - deep breaths, then shallow, then pausing. You check his pulse: only 52 beats per minute, down from 68. His blood pressure reads 185/98 on the monitor.

This indicates expanding intracranial hematoma with brainstem compression. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED: (1) Protect airway - prepare for possible assisted ventilations or intubation, (2) Maintain oxygenation greater than 90 percent, (3) Maintain SBP greater than 90 (prevent hypotension which worsens outcome), (4) Position head elevated 30 degrees, (5) URGENT transport to trauma center with neurosurgery, (6) Consider hyperventilation ONLY if signs of herniation (this case qualifies).

Consider controlled hyperventilation (10-12 breaths per minute, not excessive) as temporary measure only if herniation signs present. Prognosis very poor.

This is a LATE sign. By time full triad present, patient is herniating. Earlier signs more useful: GCS decline (most sensitive), pupillary changes (blown pupil), headache, vomiting. But if you see Cushing's triad: (1) Recognize it immediately, (2) Understand patient in extremis, (3) Prepare for respiratory failure (have BVM ready), (4) Ensure oxygenation, (5) Maintain blood pressure (don't treat the hypertension - it's compensatory), (6) Expedite transport to neurosurgery, (7) Consider calling ahead for OR activation.

But secondary injuries (hypoxia, hypotension, hyperthermia, seizures, hypoglycemia) are PREVENTABLE. Your mission: prevent secondary injury, preserve salvageable brain tissue. The two most important preventable factors: (1) Hypoxia (SpO2 less than 90 percent) - doubles mortality, damages penumbra (brain tissue around injury that's injured but salvageable), and (2) Hypotension (SBP less than 90) - reduces cerebral perfusion pressure, causes ischemia, doubles mortality. Evidence: studies show even ONE episode of prehospital hypoxia or hypotension significantly worsens outcomes. Your management: (1) Apply continuous pulse oximetry - never remove it, (2) Titrate oxygen to keep SpO2 greater than 90 percent (ideally 94-98 percent), (3) If respiratory effort inadequate (RR less than 10, GCS 8 or less, inadequate tidal volume): assist with BVM targeting normal ventilation (10-12 breaths per minute, don't hyperventilate), (4) Check BP every 5 minutes minimum, (5) If SBP less than 90: give 250-500ml fluid boluses to restore pressure, (6) But avoid excessive fluids if normotensive (may worsen cerebral edema). Balance: prevent hypotension, avoid fluid overload. Additional preventable factors: control seizures if occur (diazepam), check and correct hypoglycemia, prevent hyperthermia (remove excess blankets). But hypoxia and hypotension are the big two.
