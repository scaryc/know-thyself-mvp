Mechanism: hyperoxia (too much oxygen) causes: (1) coronary vasoconstriction (makes ischemia worse), (2) free radical formation (cellular damage), (3) reduced coronary blood flow. This patient has SpO2 96% = normoxic = well-oxygenated. His problem isn't oxygen delivery; it's that his LAD is occluded. Giving extra oxygen won't fix the blockage and may cause vasoconstriction. Correct approach: Check SpO2 first. If ≥90%, do NOT give oxygen. If <90%, give oxygen to target 94-98% (not >98%). Monitor continuously - if drops <90%, then oxygen indicated.
