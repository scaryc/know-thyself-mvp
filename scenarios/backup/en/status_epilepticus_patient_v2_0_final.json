The critical thing to assess is: is consciousness GRADUALLY IMPROVING? If yes (GCS going from 6 → 10 → 12 → 15 over 20 minutes), that's normal postictal recovery. If no (GCS stays 3 or worsens), that's concerning and suggests ongoing problem. In this case, if we treated her hypoglycemia with glucose and stopped the seizure, she'll gradually wake up over the next 10-20 minutes. This is expected. We monitor, provide supportive care, and transport - but we don't give more sedation or panic. It's normal recovery."
