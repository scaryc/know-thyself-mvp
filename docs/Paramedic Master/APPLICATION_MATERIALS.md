## Core Talking Points (Universal)

**Your Unique Value Proposition:**
"I'm a licensed paramedic who identified a healthcare training gap and built a production-quality AI solution. I bridge clinical expertise with technical execution - I understand both the medical accuracy requirements and how to build scalable AI systems."

**When they ask about lack of professional dev experience:**
"I've built production-quality code and learned industry best practices through extensive research and iteration. My clinical background actually accelerates my contribution - I understand healthcare workflows, pain points, and safety requirements that are hard to learn without direct patient care experience. I'm excited to learn from experienced engineers while bringing domain expertise most developers don't have."

**When they ask about career transition:**
"Healthcare is facing a fundamental transformation with AI. My clinical background positions me to build AI systems that healthcare professionals will actually trust and use. I can evaluate clinical accuracy, understand real-world workflows, and communicate with both medical and technical teams. This combination is increasingly valuable as AI enters clinical settings."

**When they ask "Why not stay in healthcare?":**
"I realized I could have more impact building tools that help thousands of healthcare providers rather than treating patients one at a time. AI is transforming healthcare, and we need people who understand both the clinical requirements and the technology. That's exactly what I bring."

**When they ask about technical depth:**
"My platform demonstrates real technical problem-solving: I built a multi-agent architecture, implemented cost optimization that reduced expenses by 80%, designed a scalable content pipeline, and created evidence-based clinical protocols. I'm continuously learning, and I apply new knowledge immediately - that's how I built this entire platform."
