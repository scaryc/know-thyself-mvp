## What is Know Thyself?

Know Thyself is an AI-powered training platform designed to help paramedic students practice emergency medical skills in a safe, realistic environment. You'll manage 3 different emergency scenarios, make critical decisions, and receive personalized feedback on your performance.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the Platform

Open your web browser and navigate to the training platform URL provided by your instructor.

### 2. Start Your Training Session

Click the blue **"Start Training Session"** button on the home screen.

---

## Training Flow Overview

Your training session consists of **4 phases**:

1. **Cognitive Warm-Up** (2-5 minutes)
2. **Emergency Scenarios** (2 scenarios, 10-20 minutes each)
3. **After Action Review** (10-15 minutes)
4. **Session Complete**

Let's explore each phase in detail.

---

## Phase 1: Cognitive Warm-Up

### Purpose
Before jumping into emergency scenarios, you'll answer 2-3 questions designed to activate your clinical reasoning skills. This helps you approach scenarios more thoughtfully.

### What to Expect
- Questions about clinical reasoning, diagnostic thinking, or treatment prioritization
- No "right" or "wrong" answers - just honest reflection
- Takes 2-5 minutes

### Tips
- **Be thoughtful**: Explain your reasoning
- **Don't rush**: This isn't timed
- **Be honest**: Reflection helps learning

### Example Questions
- "What factors do you consider when prioritizing treatments?"
- "How do you decide between two similar diagnoses?"

---

## Phase 2: Emergency Scenarios

You'll work through **3 different emergency scenarios** in sequence. Each scenario is a realistic emergency call where you must assess and treat the patient.

### Scenario Structure

#### A. Dispatch Information
At the top of your screen, you'll see:
- **Location**: Where you're responding
- **Chief Complaint**: Why dispatch sent you
- **Caller Info**: Who called and initial report

#### B. Patient Information
Once you arrive, you'll see:
- **Name, Age, Gender**: Patient demographics
- **Initial Presentation**: What you see when you arrive

#### C. Vitals Monitor
The right side shows:
- **Heart Rate (HR)**: Beats per minute
- **Respiratory Rate (RR)**: Breaths per minute
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**: Blood oxygen level
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**: Systolic/Diastolic
- **Temperature (Temp)**: Body temperature
- **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: Level of consciousness
- **Blood Glucose**: Sugar level

**Important**: Vitals update automatically every 5 seconds and change based on patient condition and your treatments.

#### D. Timer
Upper right corner shows:
- **Elapsed Time**: How long you've been on scene
- **Scenario Progress**: Which scenario (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)

#### E. Conversation Panel
Center of screen - where you interact with the patient

---

### How to Manage a Scenario

#### Step 1: Assess the Patient
Talk to the patient like you would in real life:
- "What's your name?"
- "Can you tell me what happened?"
- "Where does it hurt?"
- "Are you having trouble breathing?"

#### Step 2: Check Vitals
Look at the Vitals Monitor to assess severity.

**Warning Signs**:
- SpO2 < 90% (Hypoxia)
- HR > 120 or < 60 (Tachy/Brady)
- RR > 30 or < 10 (Respiratory distress)
- BP < 90/60 (Shock)

#### Step 3: Provide Treatments
Give treatments by typing them out specifically:

**Good Examples**:
- "I will apply high-flow oxygen at 15 L/min via non-rebreather mask"
- "I will administer salbutamol 5mg via nebulizer"
- "I will start an IV with normal saline at 125ml/hour"

**Poor Examples** (too vague):
- "Give oxygen"
- "Give some meds"
- "Start treatment"

#### Step 4: Monitor Patient Response
- Watch vitals change
- Listen to patient responses
- Adjust treatments as needed

#### Step 5: Complete Scenario
- **Minimum Time**: 10 minutes (button appears)
- **Maximum Time**: 20 minutes (auto-completes)
- Click **"Complete Scenario"** when ready to move on

---

### Challenge Questions (Optional Feature)

During scenarios, you might receive **Challenge Questions** - these are Socratic questions designed to deepen your thinking.

**Example**:
- You type: "Give oxygen"
- Challenge: "Can you be more specific about oxygen delivery? What flow rate and delivery method?"

**How to Respond**:
Explain your clinical reasoning:
- "I will use high-flow oxygen at 15 L/min via non-rebreather because the patient's SpO2 is 88% which indicates critical hypoxia. Non-rebreather provides the highest FiO2 for rapid improvement."

**Why We Ask**:
These questions help you develop deeper clinical thinking, not just protocol memorization.

**Don't Worry**:
- Not meant to be stressful
- No "wrong" answers
- Helps your learning

---

### Patient Notes Panel

Use this panel to document:
- Key findings
- Treatments given
- Patient responses
- Times of interventions

**How to Add Notes**:
Type in the input field and press Enter or click "Add Note"

**Good Notes**:
- "02:30 - SpO2 88%, applied O2 15L/min NRB"
- "05:15 - Salbutamol 5mg via nebulizer started"
- "08:00 - SpO2 improved to 93%"

---

### Understanding Patient Responses

#### The Patient Will:
- Respond realistically to your questions
- Show improvement OR deterioration based on your treatments
- Have vitals that change dynamically
- React to medications you give

#### If You Don't Treat:
- The patient will **deteriorate** (just like real life)
- Vitals will worsen
- Patient may become more distressed
- This is intentional - emergency medicine is time-sensitive

#### If You Give Wrong Treatment:
- Patient may worsen
- You'll receive feedback during AAR
- Use it as a learning opportunity

---

### Completing Scenarios

After 10 minutes, a green **"Complete Scenario"** button appears.

**When to Complete**:
- Patient is stable
- You've given appropriate treatments
- You're confident in your management

**After Completing**:
- Next scenario loads automatically
- Timer resets
- New patient, new emergency

After completing both scenarios, you'll automatically move to Phase 3: After Action Review.

---

## Phase 3: After Action Review (AAR)

### Purpose
Receive personalized feedback on your performance across both scenarios.

### What to Expect

#### 1. Opening (1-2 minutes)
- Warm greeting
- Invitation to reflect on overall performance
- Example: "How do you feel you did overall?"

#### 2. Scenario-by-Scenario Review (10-15 minutes)
For each scenario, you'll receive:

**Sustains (Strengths)**:
- What you did well
- Specific actions with timestamps
- Example: "You applied high-flow oxygen within 90 seconds - excellent recognition of critical hypoxia"

**Improves (Areas for Growth)**:
- What could be better
- Specific suggestions
- Example: "Salbutamol was delayed until 8 minutes. In life-threatening asthma, aim for bronchodilator within 5 minutes"

**Apply (Teaching Points)**:
- Clinical pearls
- Key concepts to remember
- Example: "Remember: Silent chest is worse than loud wheeze. Silence means no air moving - that's pre-arrest"

#### 3. Pattern Analysis (2-3 minutes)
- Themes across all scenarios
- Consistent strengths
- Recurring areas for improvement

#### 4. Action Plan (1-2 minutes)
- 2-3 concrete things to work on
- Study resources
- Practice suggestions

#### 5. Closing
- Summary of key takeaways
- Encouragement
- Next steps

### How to Engage with AAR

**Do**:
- Answer honestly
- Ask questions
- Explain your thinking
- Take notes on feedback

**Don't**:
- Rush through it
- Get defensive
- Ignore feedback
- Worry about "failing"

**Remember**: AAR is about learning, not grading. Be open to feedback.
