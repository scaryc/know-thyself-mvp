# Script with Timestamps

## [00:00-00:20] Hook & Problem Statement
**Visual:** Title screen → Problem slide

**Narration:**
"Traditional paramedic training relies on expensive mannequins and static scenarios. Medical simulation platforms face a critical bottleneck: creating realistic content requires both medical expertise AND technical development. I built Know Thyself to solve both problems."

---

## [00:20-01:00] Four-Agent Architecture Overview
**Visual:** Architecture diagram showing all four agents

**Narration:**
"Know Thyself uses a four-agent architecture spanning content creation through performance analysis.

First, Paramedic Master - a specialized AI agent that enables medical educators to author comprehensive scenarios through conversation. No coding required.

These scenarios then power three training agents: Cognitive Coach prepares students mentally, Core Agent delivers realistic patient simulation, and After-Action Review provides evidence-based feedback.

This complete pipeline solves the content creation bottleneck while delivering sophisticated training experiences."

**Visual cues:**
- Show Paramedic Master documentation briefly
- Show example scenario JSON structure
- Show flow diagram

---

## [01:00-01:20] Content Creation Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording or slides showing Paramedic Master docs

**Narration:**
"Medical educators have conversations with Paramedic Master to create scenarios. They describe the clinical condition, learning objectives, and complexity level. Paramedic Master generates comprehensive 2,000-line scenario files with evidence-based protocols, realistic vital sign progressions, and treatment responses."

**Show:** DEMO_SCRIPT.md from Paramedic Master or SCENARIO_EXAMPLE.json

---

## [01:20-02:30] Training Experience Demo
**Visual:** Live platform demonstration

**Narration:**
"Let me show you the student experience. After metacognitive preparation with Cognitive Coach..."

[Start session, show Cognitive Coach briefly]

"...students encounter a realistic patient simulation."

[Show Core Agent interaction]

"Notice how vital signs only appear when specifically measured - this teaches systematic assessment. Let me check her pulse..."

[Demonstrate progressive information disclosure]

"The safety system intervenes only for dangerous errors. Let me apply treatment..."

[Show treatment application and physiological response]

**Show specifically:**
- Vitals updating dynamically
- Natural patient dialogue
- Treatment response
- Safety alert (trigger deliberate minor error if possible)

---

## [02:30-03:00] After-Action Review
**Visual:** AAR screen showing performance analysis

**Narration:**
"After the scenario, the After-Action Review agent analyzes performance across eight clinical dimensions, providing evidence-based coaching on assessment technique, treatment decisions, and critical thinking."

**Show:** Actual AAR output with performance metrics

---

## [03:00-03:45] Technical Architecture
**Visual:** Code editor showing key files OR architecture diagram

**Narration:**
"From a technical perspective, the platform uses a novel Layer 2 architecture. Paramedic Master's comprehensive 2,000-line scenarios are dynamically reduced to 300-line contexts for each interaction, reducing API costs by 80% while maintaining clinical sophistication.

The system is built with React and TypeScript frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Claude Sonnet 4 API integration. Approximately 10,000 lines of production-quality code."

**Show briefly:**
- Project structure
- Key architectural component
- Database schema or scenario structure

---

## [03:45-04:15] Clinical Validation
**Visual:** Scenario JSON or documentation showing evidence sources

**Narration:**
"All treatment responses are evidence-based, aligned with European Resuscitation Council guidelines. The platform currently includes four complete clinical scenarios: STEMI, severe asthma, status epilepticus, and traumatic brain injury.

I'm preparing pilot testing with Slovak paramedic university students and forming a clinical advisory board for validation."

---

## [04:15-04:30] Closing
**Visual:** GitHub page or contact slide

**Narration:**
"This project demonstrates my ability to bridge clinical expertise with technical execution - identifying real healthcare training problems and building production-quality AI solutions. The complete codebase is available on GitHub. I'm excited to bring this combination of skills to [company/role type]."

**Show:** GitHub repo briefly

# Alternative: Silent Version with Text

If you prefer not to narrate:
- Use professional text overlays explaining each section
- Add background music (low volume, professional)
- Slightly slower pace to allow reading
- Focus on visual demonstration
